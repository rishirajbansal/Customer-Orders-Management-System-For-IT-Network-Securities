            This document (the DOCUMENT, as referred to hereafter) contains the terms and conditions that govern your use of the SERVICE (as defined below) and imposes material limitations to your rights. Please read this document carefully and treat it as valuable property. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">PART I - GENERAL TERMS <br />
            This document</span> <br />
            This DOCUMENT governs your use of the hosted email validation service provided by Green Apple Mail website (individually and collectively, the &quot;SERVICE&quot;). The term &quot;SERVICE&quot; includes: <br />
            <br />
            The GreenAppleMail.com website; <br />
            <br />
            Any revisions, updates and/or upgrades thereto; <br />
            <br />
            Any data, databases, computer software, or similar items customarily used or provided by the aforementioned website; <br />
            <br />
            Anything in any form whatsoever intended to be used with or in conjunction with the SERVICE; <br />
            <br />
            Any associated media, documentation (including physical, electronic and online) and printed materials (the &quot;Documentation&quot;). <br />
            <br />
            This DOCUMENT is a Legally Binding Agreement between You and Green Apple Mail and constitutes a contractual agreement between you and Green Apple Mail regarding your use of our services and website and any activities or transactions you may conduct through the company or Green Apple Mail websites. If you are acting as an agent of a company or another legal person, such as an officer or other employee acting for your employer, then &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; mean your principal, the entity or other legal person for whom you are acting. However, importantly, even if you are acting as an agent for another, you may still be personally liable for violation of federal and State laws, such as copyright infringement.  <br />
            <br />
            By signifying your acceptance of the terms of this DOCUMENT, you intend to be, and hereby are, legally bound to this DOCUMENT to the same extent as if Green Apple Mail&rsquo;s officers and you physically signed this DOCUMENT. By using the SERVICE, you agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this DOCUMENT. If you do not agree to all of such terms and conditions, you may not use the SERVICE.  <br />
            <br />

Green Apple Mail will post changes at this site, so you are encouraged to review these Terms of this DOCUMENT from time to time.

            <br />
            The rights granted under this DOCUMENT are only effective upon payment of usage fees: the SERVICE is licensed, not sold. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Acceptable Use Policy </span><br />
            We have adopted a philosophy that assumes the honesty and good intent of our customers, therefore SERVICE is provided in an unrestricted manner to allow our users to have the richest experience possible.

            <span class="style6">Fulfillment and Delivery of the SERVICE </span><br />
            Once payment has been received, the SERVICE will start within twenty-four (24) hours, unless the payment was made during a Holiday or weekend, in that case the SERVICE will start the next business day. <br />
            <br />
            Green Apple Mail will send your access details and information to the email address that you used during the sign-in process. <br />
            <br />
            Green Apple Mail offers online services only. There are no physical products to ship or software to download. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Security and Reliability</span> <br />
            The security and reliability of the SERVICE is our highest priority. We work hard to run a solid, hassle-free service. However, there are times when we cannot guarantee 100% reliability, such as: <br />
            <br />
            Internet congestion <br />
            <br />
            Automatic System Updates &ndash; Green Apple Mail&rsquo;s servers regularly update themselves with patches and bug fixes. Occasionally, these patches/fixes can affect our servers in an unexpected, detrimental way. Many of these patches/fixes are installed automatically and cannot always be tested prior to their implementation. <br />
            <br />
            Terrorist attack <br />
            <br />
            Acts of God <br />
            <br />
            Virus/Worm/Denial of Service Attack <br />
            <br />
            You specifically agree that Green Apple Mail cannot be held liable for any missing data, corrupted data, incorrect transmission of data, failure to provide service, delay of service provision or anything in any way connected to the SERVICE.  <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Accuracy of the SERVICE </span><br />
            Checking of email addresses is a complex process involving our servers communicating with external mail servers. A service of this nature cannot be 100% accurate due to factors outside of our control such as: <br />
            <br />
            Email server down or not contactable <br />
            <br />
            No mail servers defined for a domain <br />
            <br />
            Email server busy <br />
            <br />
            Mail box is full / exceeds quota <br />
            <br />
            Mail server responds with incorrect data. Specifically, mail servers that are configured to always respond that an email address exists (whether, in reality, it does or not) <br />
            <br />
            Other factors that can adversely affect accuracy include non-standard mail server implementations such as: <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6"><u>Incorrect responses from mail servers</u></span> <br />
            Some mail servers are configured to report &ldquo;valid&rdquo; email boxes regardless of whether they exist or not. These &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; results may indicate a mail box is valid when, in fact, it is not. <br />
            <br />
            Examples of these types of mail servers include (but not limited to) some installations Microsoft Exchange Server. We do our best to identify these types of servers but cannot guarantee that this flag is applied in 100% of cases. <br />
            <br />
            In the case of these &ldquo;false positive&rdquo; results, the only way of establishing a mail box validity is by sending an email to the recipient and asking them to respond. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6"><u>Issues with various &ldquo;free&rdquo; web mail providers</u></span> <br />
            The following web based email providers have been known to issue incorrect responses to our email Validator. Examples of these are:  AltaVista, Yahoo! Mail, Hotmail / Live / MSN, Gmail, AOL <br />
            <br />
            You agree and understand that our Email Address Validation services cannot, therefore, be 100% accurate. <br />
            <br />
            <u><span class="style6">Issues with other mail providers or Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</span></u> <br />
            Some email servers and/or ISPs implement extremely aggressive anti-spam policies. These policies can prevent our service from establishing the required network connection to allow email address verification. Where possible, we identify these services as &ldquo;blocked/rejected&rdquo; but cannot guarantee this in 100% of cases. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Stated Accuracy </span><br />
            Even with the external factors listed above, our email address validation services have been carefully engineered to deliver the best possible accuracy of any solution on the market. Therefore, we state our accuracy figures as between 85 to 90% based on a typical list of email addresses. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Transmission of Data  </span><br />
            You specifically agree that Green Apple Mail shall not be responsible for any unauthorized access to or modification of your data stored or alteration of your transmissions or data, any material or data sent or received or not sent or received, or any transactions entered into through the SERVICE.  You also agree that the Green Apple Mail is not responsible or liable for any content sent using, or received from, the Green Apple Mail service including that which may be illegal, obscene, offensive, defamatory, threatening or conduct of any other party or any infringement of another's rights, including intellectual property rights or that may violate any trademark or copyright. You specifically agree that Green Apple Mail is not responsible for any content sent using and/or included in the SERVICE by any third party. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Limited Liability</span> <br />
            In no event Green Apple Mail and/or its suppliers be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages or any damages whatsoever including, without limitation, damages for loss of use, data or profits, arising out of or in any way connected with the use or performance of the SERVICE, with the delay or inability to use related services, the provision of or failure to provide services, or for any information, content, services and related graphics obtained through the SERVICE, or otherwise arising out of the use of the SERVICE, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, even if service objects or any of its suppliers has been advised of the possibility of damages. Because some States / jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to you. <br />
            <br />
            In no event will the company be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, whether in an action in contract or tort, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. If, notwithstanding the above, Green Apple Mail and/or its suppliers are held to be liable for any claims arising from or in connection with this agreement or service, regardless of the form of action, the amount of such liability shall not exceed $1.00 USD. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">PART II - SECURITY  <br />
            Accounts </span><br />
            Accounts are granted to you as an individual customer. You may not share your account or divulge your logon details to third parties. <br />
            <br />
            Automated submissions (e.g. via automated scripts or &lsquo;bots&rsquo;) are not permitted. <br />
            <br />
            You are not permitted to use any of our services for malicious or intrusive purposes with a view to breaching other people&rsquo;s privacy rights. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Passwords </span><br />
            It is the end-user&rsquo;s responsibility to keep his/her password confidential, and to change the password on a regular basis. Green Apple Mail is not responsible for any data losses or security issues due to stolen passwords. Green Apple Mail encourages you to create strong passwords that contain numbers and symbols in order to prevent unauthorized users from guessing commonly-used choices (i.e. &ldquo;12345&rdquo;, &ldquo;password&rdquo;, etc.). Green Apple Mail support does not have access to viewing existing passwords. Lost passwords can be retrieved by email by clicking the &ldquo;lost password?&rdquo; link on the login screen. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Data retention policy </span><br />
            Once the SERVICE finishes validating a batch of email addresses, the customer who submitted the data can download a detailed validation report formatted, as described on Green Apple Mail&rsquo;s website. Each customer can download multiple times his validation reports and, for security purposes, may even discard both all of the validation report data and the corresponding email addresses batch from the SERVICE database at his will. In addition to that, the SERVICE automatically deletes the aforementioned records after twenty (20) days since the completion of each email validation batch. <br />
            <br />
            We do not sell, lend or market email addresses and use high security precautions to minimize the risk of having email addresses stolen from our databases, including the following best practices: <br />
            <br />
            Periodically check and upgrade both the operating system and the core system services; <br />
            <br />
            Monitor the SERVICE log to track possible malicious users; <br />
            <br />
            Both hash and salt client&rsquo;s passwords; <br />
            <br />
            Offer encrypted, HTTPS/SSL connections to our clients; <br />
            <br />
            Automatically delete uploaded lists of email addresses after twenty days since their completion. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">Pricing </span><br />
            Where a price of service has been stated it should be assumed to represent currency of United States of America (USD). Any exceptions to this rule will be specifically identified. The use of the Dollar sign ($) should likewise be taken to specify USD also. <br />
            <br />
            Prices listed on the Green Apple Mail website are subject to change without prior notification. Orders will be charged at prices in effect on the transaction day. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">References for marketing purposes </span><br />
            Unless you submit to Green Apple Mail a written request that your company and/or your Website may not be used for marketing purposes, you hereby grant Green Apple Mail the right to mention your company and/or your Website as a customer site in all of its marketing materials, including, but not limited to, Green Apple Mail's Websites, brochures, leaflets, emails, and press releases in any media format, whether electronic or printed. Such use may include listing your Website, linking to your Website, and/or displaying your company's logo as part of such listings or links. <br />
            <br />
            You may not use Green Apple Mail's name, logo, or trademarks to market your own service or product without the express written consent of Green Apple Mail. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">PART III - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY <br />
            Copyright</span> <br />
            You agree that all right, title, and interest in and to the SERVICE (including, but not limited to, any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text, and &quot;scripts&quot; incorporated into the SERVICE infrastructure) and any copyrights and other intellectual properties therein or related thereto are owned exclusively by Green Apple Mail.

            <br />
            In the event of a breach of this policy, we reserve the right to terminate your service with immediate effect, without recompense and delete any files held on our servers. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style6">PART IV - MISCELLANEOUS <br />
            This is the entire agreement </span><br />
