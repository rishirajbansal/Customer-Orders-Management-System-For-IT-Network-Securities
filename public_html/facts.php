          <td width="958" height="151" valign="top" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" ><p align="justify" class="style1">Over the last few years, the market for email service providers (ESPs) has become much more competitive than ever before. Deliverability, or the rate at which ESPs get their client&rsquo;s emails into recipients&rsquo; inboxes, has become a key differentiator between the major players. <br />
            <br />
            One major factor that helps an ESP achieve higher deliverability rates is the reduction of invalid emails sent on behalf of their clients. These invalid emails will result in hard bounces and can harm the reputation of the sender&rsquo;s servers. Why? Because many internet service providers (ISPs) use the hard bounce ratio in their algorithms when deciding whether or not to allow emails into their network. <br />
            <br />
            As a result, many ESPs now impose strict thresholds on the maximum number of bounces that their clients are permitted per account. It&rsquo;s no longer enough to simply say that a list is fully opted-in, containing only direct subscribers. If the list contains more than a percent in the single-digits (sometimes less) of invalid emails, the ESP will usually suspend the client&rsquo;s account, and ultimately withdraw the service. <br />
            <br />
            At Green Apple Mail, many of our clients have come to us as a result of this problem. They have had their email accounts suspended by their ESP even though they have built their lists diligently, using the best practices. <br />
            <br />
            Email lists, even the most initially reliable, can degrade in quality by approximately 30% each year. So if you haven&rsquo;t sent out a newsletter for even a few months, your bounce rate could quite easily exceed the ESPs acceptable threshold. <br />
            <br />
