  <div align="justify">How are email addresses checked?</div>

              <div id="a3" class="texter">
                <div align="justify">We check each and every email at multiple levels as follows:<br /><br />
                  Email syntax validation: A complete syntactical email validation is performed following the current IETF standards, including RFC 1123, RFC 2821, RFC 2822, RFC 3490, RFC 3696, RFC 4291, RFC 5321, RFC 5322 and RFC 5336. It fully supports: quoted strings, quoted pairs, internationalized domain names (IDN) and mailboxes, as well as comments and domain literals.<br /><br />
                  Domain/DNS check: We validate the DNS records for each email address under test and flag the ones which pertain to invalid, non-working and parked domains.<br /><br />
                  Disposable addresses (DEA) detection:  We detect temporarily email addresses generated by certain free services on the Internet, collectively known as disposable email address providers, such as 10MinuteMail, GuerrillaMail, MailEater, Mailinator, SpamGourmet,TempInbox,TrashMail and many more.<br /><br />
                  Mail exchanger test: We detect email addresses which do not have a valid mail exchanger. Behind the scenes, we even support many complex configurations that, despite not being widely adopted anymore in the modern web, were used in the early Internet days and can still be found in some rare circumstances.<br /><br />
                  Mailbox existence check: Check if an email address exists without sending email messages or notifying the target; it does so by emulating the behavior of common mail exchangers and employing the SMTP protocol wisely. Our service can validate even the mailboxes handled by Yahoo!, a result which is always difficult to achieve because of the strict security rules the company follows.<br /><br />
                  Temporary unavailability detection: We detect the temporarily unavailability of the mailboxes under test (like mailbox over quota errors) and automatically attempt to validate each address multiple times at specific intervals, to avoid a condition known as grey-listing and give back exact validation results.<br /><br />
                Catch-all test: We detect email addresses handled by catch-all (or accept-all, or even wildcard) mail exchangers, which accept every possible address for their domain. </div>
              </div>
                                                
<div onClick="openClose('a4')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">How fast is it?</div>

              <div id="a4" class="texter">
                <div align="justify">Very.  For the technically minded, we run multi-threaded software services on our servers to ensure we can check in average a thousand emails per minute.</div>
              </div>

              <div id="a5" class="texter">
                <div align="justify">Simply browse and upload any text, CSV or Excel file that contains email addresses you want us to validate indicating the corresponding column where you have them located.</div>

                <div align="justify">How accurate is this service?</div>
              </div>
              <div id="a7" class="texter">
               <div align="justify">Very. For various technical reasons, it is the most accurate service that you can find anywhere and we aim for over 95% overall accuracy of invalid/good emails based on a typical list.<br /><br />
Here are some of the features that we do offer that are not available in our competitors’ solutions:<br /><br />
Grey-list management – Grey-listing is implemented on approximately 10% of the world’s email servers. It is a technology that reduces spam by rejecting initial email delivery attempts. Other email checkers can’t deal with this response, ours can! Hence we get more accurate results.
Server based – Many other email verification tools are downloads that you run from your computer. There are many problems with this approach including mail servers not “talking” to dynamic IP addresses (i.e. as assigned by your ISP) and potential blocking your IP address altogether for high volumes of queries. Our service runs on servers and does not experience the problems of desktop verifiers.<br /><br />
These features are just a few reasons why our service is the most accurate available.</div>
              </div>
                                                
<div onClick="openClose('a8')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">What about soft bounces? </div>
              </div>
              <div id="a8" class="texter">
              <div align="justify">These are generally considered as email addresses that return error messages due to a full inbox quota, or where their mail server is down or experiencing issues. A few years ago, the distinction between hard and soft bounces was clear, i.e. soft bounces were OK as they were due to temporary issues. However, the treatment of hard and soft bounces is gradually converging as problems like “full inbox” generally means an email account is “dead”, as quotas are now massive even for free ISPs. We treat soft and hard bounces in the same way, as our clients ultimately want to achieve as clean a list as possible when using our service.</div>
              </div>
                                                

              <div onClick="openClose('a9')" class="mainExpand">
                <div align="justify">How often should I check email addresses?</div>
              </div>
              <div id="a9" class="texter">
          <div align="justify">For lists over 10,000 records we suggest checking every two (2) weeks. Smaller lists can be checked monthly.<br /><br />
Studies show that email lists, even the best quality ones, get outdated at approximately 30% per year. Email addresses are always changing as people switch Internet providers, move to new job / employers, change last names after getting married, and so on.<br /><br />
If your business relies on email lists for its marketing programs, it’s important that you keep the lists current and “clean” to maximize your target potential and reduce the overheads associated with managing too many “bounced” emails. This is why we recommend frequent checking.

<div id="a10" class="texter">
 <div align="justify">Go to our pricing page and choose the amount of records you want us to validate. Once you've completed checkout, the account will be created automatically online.

<div onClick="openClose('a11')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">How do I delete my account?</div>
</div>
<div id="a11" class="texter">
 <div align="justify">When a job is done you don't need to  delete permanently your account but if you'd like to so just contact us.

</div>


<div onClick="openClose('a12')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">How secure is my data?</div>
</div>
<div id="a12" class="texter">
    <div align="justify">Very. We take your security and confidentiality seriously. We know that your email lists are confidential and we do everything we can to make sure that they stay that way!<br /><br />
Your data is held securely in our data center, servers, and backup devices. As well as physical security of “locked and keyed” server rooms with ID scan, we use strong password security in our software services. This means that no-one other than you can see your data.
Once our job is done and you download your validated list from our system, it is wiped completely off our servers, making sure that all your data is securely disposed / delete so that it cannot be retrieved or viewed by anyone else.<br /><br />
Ultimately, no one gets access to your data except you.<br /><br />
As well as the assurance of security, we appreciate that you want reliability. That’s why, as a customer, you receive priority support via email. In the unlikely event of a technical problem, our promise to you is to resolve your issue within 24 hours.<br /><br />
Our systems include built in exception and error alerting to give us a proactive glimpse of what is going on. Meaning that, in the unlikely event that you need to contact us, we will usually already know about the problem and already be working on a fix for it.</div>

<div onClick="openClose('a13')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">Do you share my email lists or use them in any other way?</div>
</div>
<div id="a13" class="texter">
  <div align="justify">No. No one other than you has access to your data / email lists.</div>
</div>


<div onClick="openClose('a14')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">What browsers do you support?</div>
</div>
<div id="a14" class="texter">
  <div align="justify">Any major browser, such as, Safari, Internet Explorer (version 7+), Firefox (version 2+), Chrome and Opera.<br /> 
As this is an Internet based service, it runs on any operating system including Mac, PC, Linux, Unix etc… 
</div>
</div>


<div onClick="openClose('a15')" class="mainExpand">
  <div align="justify">Can I buy a software to validate emails?</div>
</div>
<div id="a15" class="texter">
  <div align="justify">The short answer is, yes you can! But you ought to consider a few important things first before downloading any email validation software:<br /><br />
Your IP could be blocked: Desktop software running from your own computer will very quickly end up getting your IP address blacklisted and ultimately blocked by ISPs. Why? Many ISPs treat the connections coming from desktop validation software in the same way as spammers. You will be blocked by the likes of Hotmail within minutes of running anything more than a tiny list.<br /><br />
Results might be unreliable: Your computer is most likely not configured to be a proper mail server, with PTR and SPF records etc… Most ISPs will reject validation requests coming from a source that is not configured as a mail server.<br /><br />
The software may not work at all: Your ISP may block access to Port 25, meaning you won’t be able to get it to run at all!<br /><br />
Honestly, the only way to conduct email validation in any meaningful way is to use a cloud service such as ours. Let our servers do the work for you – just upload your list, sit back and wait for the results to come!
